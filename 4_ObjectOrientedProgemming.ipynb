It is a way of organizing code and data into reusable and modular components. In OOP, objects are instances of classes, and classes are templates or blueprints that define the attributes and behaviors of those objects.\n","\n","OOP provides several benefits, including:\n","\n","1. Encapsulation: OOP allows for data and code to be bundled together into objects, which can be protected from outside interference. This helps to ensure that code is more secure, easier to maintain, and less prone to bugs.\n","2. Abstraction: OOP allows for the complexity of a system to be hidden behind a simple interface. This allows programmers to work at a higher level of abstraction, making it easier to understand and reason about the system.\n","3. Inheritance: OOP allows for the creation of new classes that inherit attributes and behaviors from existing classes. This promotes code reuse, reduces redundancy, and makes it easier to modify and extend existing code.\n","4. Polymorphism: OOP allows for objects to take on different forms or behaviors depending on the context in which they are used. This makes code more flexible and easier to extend."],"metadata":{"id":"A66YodpOTOPZ"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["**Constructor or \\_\\_init\\_\\_ method**\n","\n","In Python, a constructor is a special method (from a cathegory of methods aka *magic methods*) that is called when an object is created.

Another benefit is that they allow you to easily modify the behavior of the getter and setter methods in the future, without changing their code.\n","\n","The applications of getter and setter methods are many. Here are a few:\n","\n","1. Data validation: Getter and setter methods can be used to validate the data being set or retrieved from an attribute.

Encapsulation: Getter and setter methods help to enforce encapsulation by making sure that the class's internal attributes are not accessed directly from outside the class.\n","3. Security: Getter and setter methods can be used to restrict access to sensitive data. For example, a password attribute in a user class can be set using a setter method that encrypts the password before storing it.\n","4. Compatibility: Getter and setter methods can be used to maintain backward compatibility when modifying a class's attributes.
