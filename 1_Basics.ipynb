Encapsulation: Classes allow you to group data and functions that operate on that data into a single unit. This helps you to organize your code and make it easier to understand and maintain.\n","2. Abstraction: By defining a class, you can abstract away complex details of the implementation and provide a simpler interface for users of the class to interact with. This allows you to create more modular and reusable code.\n","3. Inheritance: Classes can be inherited from each other, allowing you to create new classes that inherit the properties and methods of existing classes. This can save time and effort when creating new code, and can help to ensure consistency across related classes.\n","4. Polymorphism: With polymorphism, you can write code that can work with objects of different classes in a uniform way. This can simplify your code and make it more flexible.\n","5. Data Hiding: Classes can use access modifiers like public, private, and protected to control access to their data and methods. This helps to ensure that the data is used in a safe and consistent way and helps to prevent accidental modification or misuse of data.\n","\n","Overall, classes provide a powerful and flexible way to organize and structure your code, making it more reusable, modular, and easier to maintain.\n","\n","In Python classes, `self` is a special parameter that refers to the instance of the class.

Code reuse: Inheritance allows you to reuse code from existing classes. Instead of writing the same code multiple times in different classes, you can define a base class with the shared functionality and have other classes inherit from it.\n","2. Polymorphism: Inheritance allows you to create objects that can take on multiple forms. For example, you can have a Bird class and a Duck class that both inherit from an Animal class. They can each have their own unique methods and properties, but they can also be treated as Animal objects.\n","3. Simplification: Inheritance can simplify the code by grouping similar methods and properties into a single class, making it easier to manage and maintain.\n","\n","Overall, inheritance is a powerful tool in Python that allows you to create more efficient, maintainable, and flexible code."],"metadata":{"id":"k0OIFTlhiG67"}},{"cell_type":"code","source":["\"\"\"\n","Q: Write a library of shapes in python including square, rectangle, and circle\n","with their attributes and functions for calculating their areas.\n","\"\"\"\n","import math\n","\n","class Shapes:\n","  def __init__(self):\n","    pass\n","    \n","  def area(self):\n","    pass\n","\n","class Rectangle(Shapes):\n","  def __init__(self, width, length):\n","    self.width = width\n","    self.length = length\n","\n","  # Over-riding the function 'area' from Shapes class.\n","  def area(self):\n","    return self.width * self.length\n","\n","class Square(Rectangle):\n","  def __init__(self, side):\n","    super().__init__(side, side)\n","\n","\n","class Circle(Shapes):\n","    def __init__(self, radius):\n","        self.radius = radius\n","    \n","    # Over-riding the function 'area' from Shapes class.\n","    def area(self):\n","        return math.pi * (self.radius ** 2)"],"metadata":{"id":"zlJBqGI0iFxj","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1680501696642,"user_tz":360,"elapsed":206,"user":{"displayName":"Zeynolabedin Soleymani","userId":"05204011441564320969"}}},"execution_count":28,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","source":["circle = Circle(1)\n","square = Square(7)\n","rectangle = Rectangle(2,3)\n","\n","print('circle area: ', circle.area())\n","print('square area: ', square.area())\n","print('rectangle area: ', rectangle.area())"],"metadata":{"colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/"},"id":"1ylgqAzOsaQL","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1680501649351,"user_tz":360,"elapsed":605,"user":{"displayName":"Zeynolabedin Soleymani","userId":"05204011441564320969"}},"outputId":"b3337942-c498-449c-80b0-95e1aaa3d4e6"},"execution_count":27,"outputs":[{"output_type":"stream","name":"stdout","text":["circle area:  3.141592653589793\n","square area:  49\n","rectangle area:  6\n"]}]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["Another interesting example for inheritance:"],"metadata":{"id":"6uumEpIutsfq"}},{"cell_type":"code","source":["class Person:\n","  def __init__(self, name, age, gender):\n","    self.name = name\n","    self.age = age\n","    self.gender = gender\n","  \n","  def introduce(self):\n","    print(f\"Hi, my name is {self.name}, and I'm a {self.age} year old {self.gender}.\")\n","\n","class Student(Person):\n","  def __init__(self, name, age, gender, grade):\n","    super().__init__(name, age, gender)\n","    self.grade = grade\n","  \n","  def introduce(self):\n","    super().introduce()\n","    print(f\"I'm a student in grade {self.grade}.\\n\")\n","\n","class Teacher(Person):\n","  def __init__(self, name, age, gender, subject):\n","    super().__init__(name, age, gender)\n","    self.subject = subject\n","  \n","  def introduce(self):\n","    super().introduce()\n","    print(f\"I'm a {self.subject} teacher.\\n\")"],"metadata":{"id":"KhcJZRPntwoD","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1680502106435,"user_tz":360,"elapsed":169,"user":{"displayName":"Zeynolabedin Soleymani","userId":"05204011441564320969"}}},"execution_count":38,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","source":["s = Student(\"Alice\", 16, \"female\", 11)\n","t = Teacher(\"Bob\", 35, \"male\", \"math\")\n","\n","s.introduce() \n","t.introduce()"],"metadata":{"colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/"},"id":"gBMjhs7vtxf-","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1680502107620,"user_tz":360,"elapsed":10,"user":{"displayName":"Zeynolabedin Soleymani","userId":"05204011441564320969"}},"outputId":"5232dc78-e452-4ed5-ee2f-1f6a25074dd3"},"execution_count":39,"outputs":[{"output_type":"stream","name":"stdout","text":["Hi, my name is Alice, and I'm a 16 year old female.\n","I'm a student in grade 11.\n","\n","Hi, my name is Bob, and I'm a 35 year old male.\n","I'm a math teacher.\n","\n"]}]}]}
