It's essentially a function that returns an iterable object, allowing you to iterate over its values using a `for` loop or by calling the `next()` function.\n","\n","The advantages of using generators include:\n","1. Memory efficiency: Generators can produce an infinite sequence of values without having to store them all in memory at once. This makes generators ideal for working with large datasets or for generating sequences that are too large to fit into memory.\n","2. Lazy evaluation: Generators only generate values when they are needed, allowing for efficient use of computing resources. Generators only generate values when requested, so they're a good fit for situations where you only need a small subset of data or where you're working with an infinite stream of data. This can be useful when working with large data sets or when the computation of the next value is expensive. This feature makes it more efficient and suitable for *parallel processing*.\n","3. Simplified code: Generators can simplify code by removing the need to manually manage state and iteration, temporary variables, or multiple loops.\n","4. Stream Processing: \n","Generators can also be used for stream processing, where you process a stream of data one element at a time. This can be useful when working with large data sets or when you want to process data as it's generated. For example, a generator that reads lines from a huge file and counts the number of words in each line.\n","5. We do not wait until all the data is generated. We can do processing while the data is generating. It is very good idea for parallel computing.\n","6. Cooperative Concurrency: Python generators can be used to implement cooperative concurrency, where the control of execution is handed back and forth between different generator functions. This allows different parts of the program to run in parallel, without the need for complex thread or process synchronization mechanisms.\n","7. Pipelining: Generators can be used to pipeline data processing operations, where each stage of processing is implemented as a separate generator function. This allows the data to be processed in parallel, as each generator function can be run on a separate thread or process.\n","8. Parallel Iteration: Python generators can be used to perform parallel iteration over large datasets.

Memory space: Each process has its own memory space, while threads within the same process share the same memory space. This means that changes made by one thread can affect the behavior of other threads within the same process.\n","2. Resource consumption: Processes are more resource-intensive than threads, as they require their own memory space and other resources such as file descriptors, sockets, and other system resources. Threads, on the other hand, share these resources, which can make them more lightweight and efficient.\n","3. Parallelism: Processes can run in parallel, as they can be executed on separate CPU cores or even on separate machines. Threads, on the other hand, can only be executed in parallel within the same process, as they share the same memory space and resources.\n","4. **Safety:** Because threads share the same memory space, they can be prone to synchronization issues such as **race conditions** and **deadlocks**. Processes, on the other hand, are more isolated from each other and therefore less prone to synchronization issues. A race condition is a situation that can occur when multiple threads or processes access shared resources or variables simultaneously, potentially leading to unexpected behavior or errors. In Python, race conditions can occur when multiple threads or processes attempt to modify the same data at the same time. \n","\n","\n","\n","---\n","\n","\n","\n","---\n","\n"],"metadata":{"id":"KXpR6fFqrWSO"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["**Function parameter vs. arguments**\n","\n","\n","---\n","\n","\n","\n","---\n"],"metadata":{"id":"nqAG0v3ABOtm"}},{"cell_type":"code","source":["def greeting(name, message = 'Hello'):  # 'name' is a parameter and 'message' is a keyword parameter and 'Hello' is the default value for that\n","  return f'{message} dear {name}!'\n","\n","print(greeting('Abed', message = 'Hi')) # 'Abed' is an argument and 'Hi' is keyword argument"],"metadata":{"colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/"},"id":"SGpG3ul3rV-_","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1682016377258,"user_tz":360,"elapsed":980,"user":{"displayName":"Zeynolabedin Soleymani","userId":"05204011441564320969"}},"outputId":"15afb798-3753-4c3d-ea8a-3b21eaa30e2f"},"execution_count":3,"outputs":[{"output_type":"stream","name":"stdout","text":["Hi dear Abed!\n"]}]},{"cell_type":"code","source":["def example_func(a=0, b=0, c=0):\n","  print(f'{a}, {b}, {c}')\n","\n","example_func(1, 2, 5)\n","\n","example_func(7, 3) # uses the default value for 'c'\n","\n","example_func(5, c=1, b=2) # order does not matter\n","\n","\"\"\" example_func(a=1, b=2, 5) :  positional argument CANNOT follow keyword argument!! \"\"\""],"metadata":{"colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/","height":86},"id":"oSbJwlNx_WUb","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1682016854950,"user_tz":360,"elapsed":355,"user":{"displayName":"Zeynolabedin Soleymani","userId":"05204011441564320969"}},"outputId":"743e106f-7486-4f2b-8538-d19904280e55"},"execution_count":12,"outputs":[{"output_type":"stream","name":"stdout","text":["1, 2, 5\n","7, 3, 0\n","5, 2, 1\n"]},{"output_type":"execute_result","data":{"text/plain":["' example_func(a=1, b=2, 5) :  positional argument CANNOT follow keyword argument!!
